**Update**
- I decided to go back and fix some functionality issues I had with this app. Checking, unchecking, and deleting are now functional on every hash of this app. I also fixed up how each different filtered view (done, to-do, all) was being rendered.

The checked task filtered views (navigated by the bottom three buttons is not fully functioning). The views are correct but the hash changes and the ajax put requests seem to be missing something.
